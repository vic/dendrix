# Dendrix - community-driven distribution of Dendritic Nix configurations.

Editor-distributions like those for nvim/emacs provide community-driven, opinionated configurations that can be easily reused and enabled by newcomers.

The `dendrix` project aims to provide the same experience: having community-managed, author-maintained and no-barrier-of-entry [setups](https://vic.github.io/dendrix/Dendrix-Layers.html) for everything that can be configured using [flake-parts modules](https://flake.parts/options/flake-parts-modules.html).

In a sense, this repository is akin to [nix-community/NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) but for flake-parts [dendritic](https://vic.github.io/dendrix/Dendritic.html) modules that can provide packages and aspects to many different nix configuration classes.

> Dendrix is an on-going effort. We already have all the code infrastructure on this repo to provide [Layers](https://vic.github.io/dendrix/Dendrix-Layers.html)
> and [aspect import-trees](https://vic.github.io/dendrix/Dendrix-Trees.html) from community repositories.
>
> However as any _community_ project, the success of Dendrix depends not on a single person, but on people willing to participate on it.
>
> Join us by using Dendrix' exposed trees or by sharing part of your configs with the community, or by joining the [discussion](https://github.com/vic/dennix/discussions) on how to better come up with community-managed configurations.
>
> It all depends on each of us.
