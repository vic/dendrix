# A pipe line for configuring an import-tree with
# dendrix community conventions, filters and API.
# > See import-tree API for reference.
#
# this is used by options.nix when creating an
# import-tree for each community.<repo>.trees.<name>
#
# By default, paths containing `private` are filtered out
# from all community import-trees.
#
# There's also an import-tree method for people who
# choose to only share files having a `community` path.
#
# Flags are a simple way of marking files by the
# capabilities they use, and still independent
# of their location in an import-tree.
#
# Flags can be present anywhere in a path and
# they consist of a plus-sign and a name: `+lsp`.
# Negation `-lsp` means: filter out files with `+lsp`.
#
# The meaning of each flag is free and conventions might
# arise as people find them useful across repositories.
#
# NOTE: flags are automatically discovered
# from files on each community import-tree.
# and documented on Dendrix README automatically.
