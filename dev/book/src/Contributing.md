# Contributing

Since we all now have agreed to follow the Dendritic
pattern to organize our files, lets take a few more guidelines to make eveybody's life easier:

- Always be nice, and have respect for others.
- Be professional and considerate we are giving our time and energy on this project as an invaluable good for others.
- Contributions are welcome as long as you also make a compromise to become maintainer for your aspect don't abandon your contribution easily. (Unmaintained files will be removed.)
- This is a community project, so as soon as your PR is merged you'll also get commit bit, however we restrict
  changes to be only via PRs and require code-owners review before merge.
- Prefer linear git history, squash PRs and no merge-commit. Vic recommends working with jujutsu.
