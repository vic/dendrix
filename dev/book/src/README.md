# Dendrix - community-driven distribution of Dendritic Nix configurations.

Editor-distributions like those for nvim/emacs provide community-driven, opinionated configurations that can be easily reused and enabled by newcomers.

The `dendrix` project aims to provide the same experience: having community-managed, author-maintained and no-barrier-of-entry [setups](Dendrix-Layers.html) for everything that can be configured using [flake-parts modules](https://flake.parts/options/flake-parts-modules.html).

In a sense, this repository is akin to [nix-community/NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) but for flake-parts [dendritic](Dendritic.html) modules that can provide packages and aspects to many different nix configuration classes.
